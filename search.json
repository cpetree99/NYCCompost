I received my Bachelor of Arts from Virginia Tech in Environmental Policy and Planning, with a minor in GIS.\n\n\nAbout the Spatial Data\nThe main Food Drop-Off Location feature layer was sourced from NYC Open Data. The data was provided by the Department of Sanitation. It was downloaded on April 17th and therefore doesn’t reflect the latest updates from the Open Data website.\nFiscal Year 2024 data was sourced from the Department of Sanitation’s Zero Waste Plan 2024 Report.\nMonthly Tonnage data by DSNY Community District was also sourced from NYC Open Data, prodivded by the Department of Sanitation.\n\n\nAbout the Informative Data\nSources for general information are linked where they have been referenced."
